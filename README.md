Boldify facilitates easier reading by boldening the first few letters of each word. Tools like this have been reported to help people with neurodiversity.

There aren't any significant scientific findings in support of Bionic Reading (The term coined for this method of reading by the company 'Bionic Reading', based in Switzerland), but there have been anecdotal claims of how it has helped some, myself included. Either way, I hope this helps anybody who could find some use for it.

Features:
- Boldify any web page.
- Toggle on and off without needing to refresh the page.
- Choose different fonts.

Current limitations:
- It may cause some links to stop working in which case you will need to refresh the page.
- Some websites have protected elements that cannot be 'Boldified'.

I wrote this extension quickly to solve a problem specific to me, so haven't included any test files just yet.
